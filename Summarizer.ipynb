      "A fire destroyed a massive Jim Beam warehouse filled with 45,000 barrels of bourbon, sending flames shooting into the night sky and generating so much heat that firetruck lights melted, authorities said Wednesday. “So when they go to put it out, there will be less contaminated runoff that goes into a drinking-water tributary.” Beam Suntory officials said the multi-story warehouse that burned contained “relatively young whiskey,” meaning it had not reached maturity for bottling for consumers. “Given the age of the lost whiskey, this fire will not impact the availability of Jim Beam for consumers,” the spirits company said in a statement. Beam Suntory officials said the distiller has a “comprehensive” warehouse safety program that includes regular inspections and “rigorous protocols” to promote safety.\n",

      "The US has declared separatist group Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which is fighting Pakistani rule in the restive Balochistan province, as a terrorist organisation, weeks after it attacked a five-star hotel in the port city of Gwadar. “The BLA is an armed separatist group that targets security forces and civilians, mainly in ethnic Baloch areas of Pakistan,” the State Department said Tuesday. “The outfit has carried out several terrorist attacks in the past year, including a suicide attack in August, 2018 that targeted Chinese engineers in Balochistan, a November, 2018 attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi, and a May, 2019 attack against a luxury hotel in Gwadar,” it added. US State Department’s ban on BLA is beyond comprehension and unjustified,” he said in a statement.\n",
