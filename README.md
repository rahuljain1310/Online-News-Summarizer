    Expired meds, indifferent staff: Delhi zoo panel red flags  
    The five-member committee looked into several claims, including cover-up of deaths of wild animals, illegal procurement of animals, and the disappearance of a Schedule X drug, Ketamine.  

An expired medicine being administered to wild animals for almost six years; “gross negligence” by staff and officers; and a possible tampering of records relating to a Schedule X drug —these are some of the findings of a high-level committee probing allegations of mismanagement at the National Zoological Park, popularly known as the Delhi zoo. From the statements of zoo officials, the committee found that those in charge of care of the Sika deer were either engaged with foreign delegates at the time, or placed responsibility to examine the deer on other officers, who also failed to visit the enclosure on June 17, 2016. Another allegation the committee probed was also based on a report by Dr Singh — on “illegal procurement of the ketamine drug, which went missing from the zoo.” The invoice of the company from which ketamine was sought shows that an order was placed by a zoo official for one 50 ml vial on September 5, 2015. Statements of two zoo officials mention that the entire 50 ml drug was issued on January 25, 2016, of which a quantity of 28 ml was used 23 times for the treatment of different animals, with 14 ml kept in dart syringes.

The Centre on Wednesday opposed in the Delhi High Court a PIL for making IPC sections pertaining to rape gender-neutral, saying the perpetrators are mostly men and therefore, the legislation has been enacted to check the rising number of sexual offences against women. The Ministry of Home Affairs, in its additional affidavit before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, said the sections have been enacted after due deliberation and widescale consultations. The ministry was responding to a PIL by Sanjjiiv Kkumaar, who has said that the “IPC 375 and IPC 376, in current form, which is gender specific and not gender neutral, doesn’t secure males and thus doesn’t stand the constitutional test and fails in Right to Privacy”. Kkumaar, an activist, had also pointed that as per the recent apex court ruling on Right to Privacy, both male and female have equal protection of law under the Constitution.

    Fire destroys Jim Beam warehouse filled with bourbon barrels  
    Jim Beam is the world's largest bourbon brand. The classic American whiskey brand is owned by Suntory Holdings Ltd., a Japanese beverage company.  

A fire destroyed a massive Jim Beam warehouse filled with 45,000 barrels of bourbon, sending flames shooting into the night sky and generating so much heat that firetruck lights melted, authorities said Wednesday. “So when they go to put it out, there will be less contaminated runoff that goes into a drinking-water tributary.” Beam Suntory officials said the multi-story warehouse that burned contained “relatively young whiskey,” meaning it had not reached maturity for bottling for consumers. “Given the age of the lost whiskey, this fire will not impact the availability of Jim Beam for consumers,” the spirits company said in a statement. Beam Suntory officials said the distiller has a “comprehensive” warehouse safety program that includes regular inspections and “rigorous protocols” to promote safety.
